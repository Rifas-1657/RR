  {

    a: 'Long-form learning material: recorded lectures, tutorial videos, podcasts, or conversations. Bookey restructures the source into chapters and pages, then adds narration, diagrams, and practice where they help.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are answers from the voice tutor made up?',
    a: 'The tutor is designed to answer from your source first and point back to the moment it came from. When something goes beyond the source, it says so instead of presenting it as part of the material.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to install anything to run the code?',
    a: 'No. Practice snippets are meant to run right on the page, so you can edit an example and see what changes without setting up a local environment.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are the courses on this page real?',
    a: 'The Python, Java, Machine Learning, and Web Development books shown here are demo courses that illustrate the experience. They are labeled as demos wherever they appear.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I learn at my own pace?',
    a: 'Yes. Books are split into short pages, your place is saved, and you can bookmark, take notes, and replay narration whenever you come back.',
